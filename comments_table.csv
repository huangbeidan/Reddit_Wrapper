"Submission(t3_9xead9)</r/netflix is not your sociopolitical soapbox. This subreddit is not affiliated with the website at all, it's for fans of the service. If you don't like something, let Netflix know: 1 (866) 579-7172.>","[The mod team has been advised that rather than calling Netflix customer support when you don't like something they're doing, you're far more likely to get a helpful response if you send a letter to Netflix's corporate offices. The link below has mailing addresses to use in various Netflix countries.[https://help.netflix.com/en/node/2101](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/2101), Wait what happened I'm out of the loop, Is this  your first time on this sub. It's always a bitch fest here., [deleted], CAN WE STOP AUTO PLAYÂ¿Â¿Â¿, [deleted], Sounds like Reddit as a whole., Seriously: If you transported someone from 2008 to 2018 and immediately had them read this sub, they'd say, ""Wow, Netflix is really unpopular -- I see they transitioned from DVDs by mail to streaming, clearly that was a huge mistake."" They'd never guess that in the real world, Netflix continues to add subscribers like crazy and clean up at awards shows., [deleted], To be completely fair, Netflix probably do read viewer comments here. With a company as modern as Netflix their marketing people would be doing a crappy job if they didnâ€™t look at whatâ€™s being said about them online and in their namesake subreddit , Asking for netflix features is annoying but that's not what this post is about. This is a mod basically saying we can either talk about how we like a netflix show or we can stfu., finally a subreddit without people crying, Go to r/baseball ?&amp;#x200B;( *There's no crying in* r/baseball *)*, Some whiny buttbaby was upset about there being prominent gay characters and minorities in the new Sabrina series., This post makes it sound like the sub is affiliated., ""*This is a marketing sub, not a customer feedback or content discussion sub you idiots!*""Basically summed it up for the OP. , Reading comprehension matters. That's not what OP said at all ..., Make sure to kill any chance at interesting conversation so thereâ€™s plenty of room for more posts about how awful the auto-play menus are, why selection sucks in country x, and how Netflix Originals are no longer either original or good., I can see why people get confused when the sub uses the actual logo of Netflix., On a condom packet..., I am firmly opposed to the mung bean legislation! I'm calling my congressman to complain. Also calling Netflix because I'm pissed they haven't done a docudrama on mung beans. FUCK YOU NETFLIX!, I know exactly what Ryan is talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk. Very nutritious but they smell like death., Yall need to start placing them in bags. I like to put them in with a damp towel hanging on the wall., So you can mention if you like a show but not if you don't?, Where are people supposed to bitch about anything if they can't do it here? It seems to me like an important feature of this sub would be giving people a place to bitch about shit they don't like., The problem is that I look at the sub as a casual user and half of the posts are people bitching about every little thing about Netflix.  Frankly, Netflix is a god send compared to what the major networks would have us watch and pay.  It's not perfect but NBC, CBS, abc, and fox have had more than enough time (at least 40 years) to do something better and all they did was push products and make formulaic garbage that insults our intellect.  And yet the users on this sub bitch constantly about Netflix and don't say one word about what the alternative was and is - fucking garbage or illegal piracy, I get where you're coming from, but personally I've had to switch back to pirating even though I have access to netflix because their catalog has been getting super sparse lately and they've been mostly just publishing Netflix originals that I don't have time to give a shit about. , [removed], Yelling at somebody over the phone is fundamentally different from complaining about on social media. That distinction should be immediately obvious to anybody having an honest discussion, you could, you know... get a LIFE?&amp;#x200B;, [removed], Lol, How about we talk about shows how we want and let the upvote/downvote system do its job? , Yeah I mean I don't go on this sub, I'm just here from /all, but it seems bizarre to say you can't discuss why you don't like a show on a forum designed to discuss shows.I mean, why don't we all just watch what we want, and not watch what we don't want, like the mods are suggesting? Then wtf is the point of this sub exactly?, You are completely missing the point.  This is banning people from making ""appeals"" to Netlix ""Netflix, Please bring back SHOWILOVE for a third season!"" People do this on so many subs, like it's the correct place to make a ""suggestion"".  It's annoying as shit, I'm glad the mods are doing something about it, I think what the mod is trying to say is that people spend too much time shitting on shows instead of having thoughtful discussions about them, it's toxic and there's no need to do that, which the OP clearly stated. , What does that mean , Lol what the fuck is the point of this post?  Who are you talking to?, I agree with this in part but your post sounds like this place should only be for posts praising Netflix.  I'm not exactly sure what you are upset about but I agree politics are better left on a sub dedicated to a site on that subject.  This place should a reason-based discussion of Netflix shows we want to watch and which ones we feel people should avoid.Opinions on shows will always vary.  The discussion should be about the shows themselves and not external factors., Mods are getting paaaid off by Netflix corporate. Same thing happened to /r/politics with Shareblue replacing all the mods., really?!, What about people who like a show and then launch into political/sociopolitical speech about why they like it... even if it appears to be a positive it still irritates those who disagree politically or whatever. , Did you just learn the terms sociopolitical and soapbox or something? Because you sure use them a lot., Fans can't have criticism or negative opinions. Got it. Shame this sub is pointless then. , Wait, so youâ€™re saying this subreddit canâ€™t handle negative reviews or criticism of shows?  This sounds just like what Netflix actually did by taking reviews off their application because of the swath of bad reviews from their shows., What exactly are we supposed to discuss here if we can't talk about the politics behind the shows on Netflix? Is that not a relevant discussion? Maybe we should ban discussing House of Cards and 13 Reasons Why because those shows among many others on Netflix are certainly ""sociopolitical.""I'm guessing that some people were posting topics that fell under wrongthink regarding the new Witcher and She-Ra shows. We already have an upvote system that can determine if those topics should be discussed and there is nothing in the rules saying that they can't be. I just hope that we truly see fair moderation. No one can talk about how it's good to have racial representation on a show or how a show dealt with LGBT topics since those would fall under ""sociopolitical."" Or is it only ""sociopolitical"" soapboxing when you disagree with what is being said?, [deleted], You trust users to upvote and downvote to filter things out? If mods just let that decide what is on a sub there would be nothing but shitty memes posted all day., so basically we aren't allowed to say we dont like a show unless its for a reason the mods approve of.  , No. Not at all.There's a very clear nuance, Hey! Nobody is forcing you to read people's posts! If you don't like them, you don't need to conplain! SIMPLY STOP READING THEM., Lol so only talk about the show if you like the show, other wise don't post here.  This post seems like it may have been a bit rushed in the heat of the moment.  , Interesting. Don't discuss Netflix shows unless you have positive things to say. , [deleted], Mods aren't paid by reddit tho... Why would any of them care if Netflix complained to them?, [deleted], That is an interesting take on this post. I took the post as : ""We dont give a fuck about your politics, so shut the fuck up. If you have a problem contact netflix"" Consider thinking before posting. , Let's look at this part:&gt;If you wish to discuss a show, feel free, but if you don't like a show, no one's holding a gun to your head to continue watching it. Just stop watching it. You don't need to make a post about it, you don't need to express your sociopolitical/political views upon others here that may enjoy the show... you just need to stop watching it.Now this says that if you don't like a show, don't post about it and just stop watching it. Now to me that means: 'Don't discuss Netflix shows unless you have positive things to say.', You sound like somebody who likes their safe spaces. , Patriotism vs nationalism. Patriots-  I love this but it can be betterNationalist-  I love this no matter what.I don't know what it would be called in the corporate world , Interesting, i just checked Netflix Help Center and there's only a US toll free number?Nothing for the international market? Just asking. Working techsupport has damaged me, with all the requests of customer actually wanting to talk to someone and not havng to use chats or email. , &gt; Interesting, i just checked Netflix Help Center and there's only a US toll free number?&gt; &gt; Nothing for the international market? Just asking.When I looked for international toll-free numbers, I couldn't find one, so I just put the US Toll-Free number, my apologies., No need for apology. :), Were you on netflix.com? That's an American site. Of course its going to have American numbers., Not sure what you mean. AFAIK there's no country specific domain for netflix. , wat, We can only talk about shows if we like them? Ew. In that case, Daredevil is totally great in seasons 1 &amp; 3. No numbers exist between 1 &amp; 3, Oh and so the over-moderation begins., on the other subs where I've seen this happens, the number of interesting posts drops and so does my interest.....although a couple of subs have been able to come back from that, but only after a couple of years, [removed], Posts to /r/netflix are expected to follow reddiquette. We noticed your post did not do that, so we removed it. Please visit reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette to better understand why it was removed., Couldn't care less about the political stuff, but why is there an All Countries flair, right next to an American phone number?, [deleted], Not really making an issue of it, it's just a comment. Though American centralism is a bitch of a thing, and incredibly annoying., &gt; but why is there an All Countries flair, right next to an American phone number?I couldn't find the international Netflix number, my apologies. The message stands for all countries though., The phone number you see on the help center for Netflix is regional, so based on your location, it changes as needed. Best to just link help.netflix.comThat being said, please dont call Netflix to bitch about shows. That number is for customer service assistance with billing, accounts, and troubleshooting issues. Calling about content complaints goes almost no where. Source: former Netflix employee, Shut up and quit talking already. , I'm going to end my subscription soon with netflix because they got rid of most of the dvd's, the content is subpar for me...I don't like the new shows they have, and I don't like netflix's political affiliations., If the majority of the sub wants to use it that way then who are you to decide what is right?, Well I think he's the goddamn moderator and if you want a sub to bitch in you should make your own and see how many people show up., Just because someone is a mod doesn't mean they should get every thing they want., Donâ€™t tell me where to put my soapbox. , I understand but many of the shows are socio-political? We are not allowed to point out the racism in Dear White People, and the socio-political motives behind Sense8 or others?, White skin is a genetic disorder called albinism and not a race. Its time everyone accepts it., oh look, reddit will be censoring another sub where people are awakening to the endless leftist propaganda being shoved down their throat., This is a perfect example of the type of posts this sticky is talking about _Ÿ˜‚If you donâ€™t like it, go to voat.com which is basically Reddit but for right wingers. Free market baby! Capitalism at its best. , Honestly this has been happening across all subreddits. Iâ€™ve seen posts in /r/StarTrek trying to push down the new seriesâ€™ efforts at diversity when the whole point of Star Trek is to celebrate diversity. Itâ€™s bizarre. I know this sounds paranoid but I think thereâ€™s a concerted effort at trolling and brigading to influence opinion online. I think itâ€™s to push a certain type of philosophy. Youâ€™ll see it across the most random subreddits then you click through the OPâ€™s history and see where he normally posts and realize what itâ€™s really about. Itâ€™s a little scary tbh. , Wtf?! Star Trek practically invented diversity on the small screen. , &gt;  I know this sounds paranoid but I think thereâ€™s a concerted effort at trolling and brigading to influence opinion online. I think itâ€™s to push a certain type of philosophy.Uh this has been widely apparent for a decade., It's an internet thing in general. Prior who would never say things in real life feel encouraged to express their opinions online because they won't experience backlash for it. Also, it's ironic to be into Star Trek and have a problem with diversity even though there are like, fucking aliens featured throughout the show. Klingons are ok but not women or POC? It's ignorant., &gt; I think thereâ€™s a concerted effort at trolling and brigading to influence opinion onlinethis is 100% happening , Just so you're aware, that's exactly the thing that the people you're talking about would say too. Neither side is a conspiracy. Waves in the zeitgeist is just that. You can scoff at, or think that overly blunt sociopolitical commentary in entertainment is to the detriment of it. You can even express dissatisfaction at these things without being a troll. , This person Iâ€™m specifically referring to never posts in this subreddit, posts repeatedly in another, and is making a case completely antithetical to the very heart of Star Trek. No that is not the same thing. That is not just expressing generic dissatisfaction. And at the same time they post, other accounts comment who never comment shortly after this person posts.     I am more than aware of what youâ€™re saying, but what youâ€™re saying is not what Iâ€™m describing. , It might not be affiliated, but I know for a fact that this subreddit is on the radar of Netflixâ€™s various teams.Like what kind of bullshit is this? The subreddit doesnâ€™t need to be affiliated with Netflix to be seen as a good soapbox to stand on for Netflix to see., So Iâ€™m relatively new to this as a sub but Iâ€™m confused on what this apparent problem is. Iâ€™ve not seen any posts that were like as described and while Iâ€™ve only had one attempted post that was deleted because it was an attempt to gain traction for Netflix to make a show. I realized my mistake on the posting and deleted it after I read the auto mod description. However I dont see the problem if people are just posting complaints if the description of this subreddit says Netflix discussion. It is rather misleading if we arenâ€™t supposed to post something criticizing a show if discussion is part of the subs purpose. Now I havenâ€™t seen any of the posts that matches this description and could be misunderstanding the problem a hand. , I hate autoplay.  Mods pls fix asap., I bet we can muster up some bipartisan support on an autoplay reform bill., Booo hooo bad people donâ€™t like a show I think is important, because it pushes an ideology on others with the grace of an elephant. Criticizing IMPORTANT shows ist verboten! Love that shit or go away, no mean text plz ;(     (ps. im a grown up mod handling my shit like a mature adult, definetly not a snowflake), Netflix has gone past PC into rhe absurd. The hatred for people not of color is astounding., Examples? , What? I donâ€™t like some Netflix originals. They suck. I canâ€™t stand them. Discuss _Ÿ˜‚, You can discuss why you don't like them, just don't turn it into a Sociopolitical / Political post promoting your own agendas., [removed], What if my agenda is the need to remove sociopolitical/political arguments from Netflix discussions?Checkmate, /r/Netflix mods., thank you! , Thank you guys so much of keeping all that BS out, Iâ€™m sick of getting on Reddit for that exact reason. Politics is not the only thing in the world., internet right wingers: I hate censorship. Netflix shouldn't be allowed to show these shows, Netflix originals are worse than aids and lack any soul to them. , Your Netflix website stinks man! Why should I call the number when youâ€™re right here. Netflix stinks!!!!, Not to start a flamewar, but what the hell kinda political soapboxing could Netflix shows elicit?, &gt;you just need to stop watching it.but..but how? , Iâ€™ll advise against calling their customer service to file a complaint with anything unless youâ€™re willing to troubleshoot a technical problem. They are there for billing inquires and technical issues. While the call is recorded the csr has no way to submit feedback. Letters are read, send something to their HQ in Los Gatos California. , I have found it very difficult to get the reps to even acknowledge a request to send a message to headquarters.  I could not find an email address to send in comments to.Calling customer service for a complaint is just about the right thing to do with a complaint - aren't they customer service?, Trust me, they scramble for the same info. Netflix used to be open to pretty much everything ex: they used to take show ideas from the general public, good luck pitching a show to Netflix now without an in with a company already doing business with Netflix. There is no way to get a message to corporate through the cs phone number. It could be that a good majority of the csr reps are outsourced., But.... but... female comedians say â€œpussy.â€ù, Hello. Is here anybody from australia?? If it is please contact me. I need some help. And i will be thankful if someone help me._Ÿ˜¯_Ÿ˜¯_Ÿ˜”, [removed], No one forces you to read the posts..., No one forces those people to use Netflix, Well said, Amen, Noted, Thank the new chat rooms. There's been an influx of shit content posted by month old accounts all over the place., You should see all the trolls on Netflix's facebook page. Just a huge amount of pathetic losers out there., Hell Yeah! This post needs to be out there!, While we're at it can we also quit with the ""What should I watch next?"" posts? :-p, I donâ€™t mind those. Iâ€™ve had a show or two brought up in that conversation that Iâ€™ve checked out. But the â€œNetflix forcing a gay conservative atheistic liberal Christian agenda down my throatâ€ù posts are ridiculous. , &gt; But the â€œNetflix forcing a gay conservative atheistic liberal Christian agenda down my throatâ€ù posts are ridiculous.And that's why I made this post., [deleted], those are great conversation starters and i have found quite a few shows from them. So my vote would be to keep them. , But they're all the same - maybe they could just learn how to search first?, No, because I've actually found some good shows via those posts., I'm new to this sub, but the ones I have seen the past weeks are all 100% identical.  Searching would be the best way for these people to find their next show....  Wouldn't a monthly mega-thread solve the problem way better?, Yeah I watched the entire 15 seasons and realized I hated it , Itâ€˜s like Gritty people search for orientation in there lives ]"
Submission(t3_acbr2e)<â€œSkip Introâ€ù should be allowed as a permanent setting>,"[At least there's a skip intro option.  Man we're a spoiled bunch nowadays haha, it's a legal issue that the option is not permanent - used to work for them and actually worked on this feature, Curious why the option is even allowed then.  , They started it. Itâ€™s natural that we ask for more. , Lol very true, I agree but there should also be an option to disable skipping intros for people who like to watch em and get triggered when netflix randomly skips recap+intro while binging aka me. , Also a ""Skip credits to after credit scene"" if there is one. , Nice. That would be cool , Then you would miss all the yelping in the ""The Last Kingdom""., As long as they add an opposite. I love watching an intro, and even seeing the little â€œskip intro boxâ€ù is a nuisance. An incredibly minor one that bothers me only the teensiest bit, but, hey, I want everything!, I miss skip intro when I watch HBO Go, or any other streaming service.  It really is fantastic.  On the other hand, I enjoy the intro every once in awhile.  I would say have an option to make it permanent, while leaving current functionality as an option, would be best.  Everyone wins then., I can't believe its 2019 and still not, There's a chrome ad on called Never Ending Netflix. Which makes skip intro default and it auto plays the next episode without the countdown. I can watch so much The Office. , I have mine set where I have to tell it to play the next episode. I watch on my Kindle in bed to help me fall asleep, and I had way too many times where I fell asleep, it kept playing, and I missed a couple of episodes, and I had to go back and watch them again., Thatâ€™s awesome. I donâ€™t use the computer to watch so the add on wonâ€™t work for me. But I am on my fifth go around of The Office. , Also the credits after the episode ends. Ainâ€™t nobody got time to sit there for 15 seconds. Next. , Also an option to disable asking if Iâ€™m still watching. I donâ€™t want any interaction at all dammit!, Intros aren't always the same and not always timed correctly I find. , Yeah but then thereâ€™s shows like bojack horseman that always have unique intros , What I don't get is why Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt DOES have a skip intro button.  Who would ever want to skip that intro?  That song earworms me....DAMMIT., I was watching a show on Netflix today on my Roku Ultra. One episode ended, when the countdown to the next episode ended it jumped to the next episode as usual, but it jumped ahead in the episode to just after the opening credits/intro. Just as you suggest. Hadn't ever noticed it before. Does noone else's do this? , If I'm watching a show for the first time, I will watch the intro, then onwards it is ""Skip Intro""., I would love this. When you binge a show, the theme song gets really old really quickly., Yup skip every into except the first one. , There you go. That makes it even better. You get the option to skip the first one and then no intro after that. , Some places on Earth "" I hope I find enough food to keep me alive until tomorrow. Being a child soldier is rough. They'll kill me if I don't participate in the r***s""Here in the land of air conditioning : "" Netflix should be more convenient..."", Oh wow, people on the Netflix subreddit suggesting ways to make Netflix more convenient?, No, my point is that this is a total non issue.

Submission(t3_ac6j2o)<The Punisher S2 | Teaser Trailer>,"[Omg Billyâ€™s face... I literally facepalmed with how pretty he still looks, he should have major fucking damage, Frank SHREDDED his face. He should have a fucked up eye or something too. Really keen for this season but Iâ€™m a little disappointed with his look not gonna lie., From an interview with Ben Barnes &gt; At the end of the first season, we hear the doctors sort of saying that that Benâ€™s undergone surgery for stab wounds and wounds on his face, so heâ€™s had a plastic surgeon try to fix him...Itâ€™s not about his face, itâ€™s about the psychological, which is really something we wanted to focus on this season, I can accept that from a writer's perspective but on the flipside what if AMC had done that with Arseface in Preacher?, Agreed! Ben Barnes is a really handsome man, it would have been amazing if they seriously fucked his face up like Jigsaw. Would have been that much more tragic to see his good looks torn up and really added to his mental damage. , Yeah I agree. I was hoping for the Punisher War Zone look but he's just got a couple scratches compared to that. It's like they forgot why he's called Jigsaw., Fact bro!&amp;#x200B;, Hell yea! Hyped! Even though I am a little disappointed how Billy is not as scared as I thought he was. Maybe that's going to change, who knows. , This looks amazing.  I'm sure Netflix will cancel the series in February., Hopefully we just get a good ending to this season then I guess , Off to a bad start with Billyâ€™s face, January 19th they announce the cancellation. , Or Disney will ask for an insane amount to continue... Edit: you gotta be a dumbass to not believe that just saying., 100% I expect 1. Disney is charging too much for the I.P to continue the Marvel series 2. Disney plans to take production over and put these shows on its own streaming service., I heard that one of the possible endings to Bandersnatch shows an alternate timeline in which Punisher isn't cancelled.  I'm still trying to find that ending., Season 2 synopsis:&gt;Former marine-turned-vigilante Frank Castle (Jon Bernthal) has been living a quiet life on the road until he suddenly becomes embroiled in the attempted murder of a young girl (Giorgia Whigham).

This mother fucking show! I canâ€™t wait. , His face needs to be more fucked up. Like not as much as the 2008 jigsaw but more than what is there. , Oh hey, I wonder if we can have a thread about the Punisher where most of the comments aren't about people complaining about a hypothetical cancellation. Guess not. Do we need to write the same comments in every thread three times a week?, It's cancelled, period. Accept it., Sure. Might it still be possible to talk about the second season that's still coming out? Or do we need another 100 comments of ""haha cancelled on January 19th amirite"" everyday?, If Netflix cancels this show, I may as well cancel my subscription. THIS LOOKS AMAZING, great show!! please dont cancel, Second and last season., Netflix finna punish this show after this season.Also, I'm really hoping they toned down Billys scars just for this promo , Soo canceled on the 19th then?, Beat me to it by about 35 minutes , I know the season's gonna be great but there will be another post here on Jan 19th.. --""Punisher got cancelled""., Wow this trailer looks really shitty, It's only a teaser, it's not meant to blow you away., But it's meant to tease me which this really doesn't, Netflix has really fucked up this year. Cancelling good shows that people watch which are also genuine Netflix originals. Meanwhile FRIENDS and The Office are both about to magically become â€œNetflix Originalsâ€ù so Netflix can keep them on their platform in good conscience. The same ego that told NBC to fuck off with a giant amount of money is now the same ego that is deciding to be a petty child in charge of a streaming service. Iâ€™m glad I cashed out my Netflix stock. , I understand your frustration. But Friends and Office bring in lots of money. While Daredevil was amazing, along with the other Marvel properties depending on your personal opinion, itâ€™s smart to assume that they didnâ€™t make as much money as Friends and Office. Also Iâ€™m not certain it was 100% Netflixâ€™s decision. Mostly because itâ€™s a huge coincidence that all these Marvel properties are getting cancelled within a year of Disney Plus coming out. , you are WOEFULLY ill informed.. lets start with the cancellations of the marvel series, these cost ALOT of money to make ALOT. Netflix gets absolute pennies for them because of cost and rights so they need to have insanely high viewership for them to get a good return, last i checked they were actually losing money, even on daredevil... sooo the cancellations were because they werent making money off expensive shows... secondly the office and friends are not becoming fucking netflix originals ever. Friends is a huge piece of television and the company that owns the rights to this can make a killing off of it and it would be a centerpiece to any streaming platform, netflix paid 100 million to keep it for one more year but they WILL lose it next year to the company that owns it. The office will likely stay for a while unless the company who owns the rights decides to exclusively put it on their platform and that hasnt happened yet, &gt; these cost ALOT of money to make ALOTIf you're going to put it in all caps twice, you should know it's ""a lot"". ""Alot"" isn't a word. I fuck it up all the time too., &gt; these cost ALOT of money to make ALOT.And people should stop pretending Disney is not asking for more because of their own streaming project. Of course Disney want to kick Netflix in the balls. , Bro they would be paying large amounts of money to a competitor if they kept the marvel shows on there. What company or business would willingly give their competition free publicity and sell their merchandise for them? Come on man., This. Is. A. Bad. Teaser. Wow., Not much of a teaser, Do you understand the concept of a teaser?, Yes, and that wasn't much of one.]"

Submission(t3_acee4b)<Why cant you watch Bandersnatch on Apple TV?>,"[Netflix quit paying the â€œapple tax.â€ùAnd honestly, why should they pay it? There are plenty of other devices out there. , The stickied post on this subreddit explains exactly this!]"
Submission(t3_acb7tf)<Netflix is now a stand alone provider of tv entertainment.>,"[I actually stopped watching TV years ago. It happened pretty naturally actually- since Youtube got popular, everything I want to watch can be streamed online.  After moving out of my parents house last year and getting my own apartment and working, I actually never bought a TV for myself- all my viewing is either on laptop or phone.  Funny how that works out.  I loved TV as a kid, and will occasionally watch it if I go to someone's house that has one, but I can get by just fine without it.  New technology can really change the game.   I doubt TV will ever go away (just like even though radio was the 'go-to' entertainment until TV came along, and yet still has its place today), as I think older generations are more used to it- but younger ones are more adaptable.  I just can't wait for other tech like AR/VR technology to get market-ready and cost-effective for it to be widespread, I can think of some really game-changing uses for it (classrooms, Skype, gaming, movies)- which I think will really change the paradigm for how we consume entertainment.  It's one of those things you really have to try for yourself to know what the hype is about - I bought a Samsung Gear VR, and using the Ocean Rift app, it really feels like you're underwater.  When a shark snaps at you, you flinch!  It's really convincing to the reptilian part of your brain, at least so say the people that try it.  Here a sweet video of a gamer showing an Apollo 11 Space VR program to his dad, who cried [tear of joy as he experienced it](https://youtu.be/NGVxud9N2gQ)., &gt;Even if I sat around and watched Netflix all day, Iâ€™m not sure I could get sick of it. Sounds like a dare to me. , Challenge accepted, Meh the only reason I subscribe to netflix is for the frequent new original productions. The increase in back catalog content from the past is a waste of money. The moment netfilx cant keep/exceed its current pace is the moment half the base dissolves]"
